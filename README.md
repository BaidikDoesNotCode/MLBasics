**_Project#1_**
_Housing Price Predictor_
SKlearn, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas.
Approach:
1) Load the California housing dataset using sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing().
2) Convert it into a DataFrame with proper column names and target values.
3) Explore the data – check structure, correlations, missing values.
4) Visualize key features vs price.
5) Preprocess – (this dataset is mostly clean, so little needed here).
6) Split data into training and test sets.
7) Train a Linear Regression model.
8) Predict prices and evaluate performance using MSE and R² score.
9) Visualize actual vs predicted prices.
